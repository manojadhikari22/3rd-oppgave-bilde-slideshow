# picture Slideshow
### About this project

This is a regular photo slideshow project. We can browse the photos interactively by clicking on the image itself, with the ← → arrow keys, and by swiping left/right on mobile. The slideshow also contain dedicated buttons to go to the previous/next image, as well as buttons to navigate to one particular image.

This project was developed using modern HTML, CSS, and javascript.
